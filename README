Name:    Terry Griffin

Purpose: 
 
Takes all of the files downloaded from Sigspatial Cup and loads them into a MySQL
database. Has nothing directly to do with a solution, but makes it easy to 
visualize some of our ideas using "OpenLayers".  The visualization portion is not 
included.

There's no configuration for paths and such. You can change the code based on where 
you extracted the files.
			
No primary keys or indexes included in the table creation. That's also up to you.
